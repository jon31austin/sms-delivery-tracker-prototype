# Overview
This chat-based interface is a prototype for a potential delivery-tracking system. 

# Features 
This prototype tests the following user interactions: 
- denying incorrect orders 
- correcting incorrect delivery information 
- checking status while order is in transit or pending 
- contacting courier and recipient
- receiving updates after an uncertain amount of time
- handling failed deliveries
- providing overall feedback to courier service

Some user flows have been randomized to simulate a more realistic experience. 

Please run the prototype multiple times in order to experience different flows.
